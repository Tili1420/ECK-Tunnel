// "Who restarted the tunnel at three in the morning" had no answer. Nor did

// about the request that caused it.
//
// The record is written by the authorisation guard rather than by the handlers.
// A log each handler writes for itself is a log with one hole per handler
// somebody forgot to update, and those holes are invisible until the day
// somebody goes looking. Written at the choke point, the only way to perform an
// action without recording it is to perform it without being authorised.
//
// Reads are not recorded. A panel that is being polled every few seconds would
// otherwise bury the handful of lines that matter under thousands that do not,
// and a record nobody can read is not a record.
