// connections that should have been let through, or a half-published pointer.

// the lock is held only long enough to copy an interface value, never across a

// netControl holds the control channel for the transports that use a plain
// network connection (tcp, tcpmux, udp, kcp).
// controlWriteTimeout bounds a write on the control channel.
//
// Every byte this channel carries is one byte: a heartbeat, a request for a
// pool connection, a shutdown notice. None of them is worth waiting on, and
// waiting on one is what took a tunnel down for a quarter of an hour at a time.
//
// A write goes into the kernel's send buffer and returns; when the peer stops
// absorbing anything the buffer fills and the write blocks until the kernel
// stops retransmitting, which is around fifteen minutes on Linux defaults. For
// that whole window the server believes it has a control channel: it refuses
// the client's attempts to make a new one because one is "already
// established", it cannot ask for pool connections because the request reaches
// nobody, and it drops every user connection with the queue full. The tunnel is
// down and nothing but a restart by hand clears it.
//
// Ten seconds is far longer than a healthy path needs for one byte and far
// shorter than a broken one takes to admit it. Past that the channel is treated
// as gone, which is what it is — the transport restarts, and the client's next
// claim is accepted instead of refused.
